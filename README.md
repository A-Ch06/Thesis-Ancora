# Automated Nutrient Estimation from Food Images Using Machine Learning and Image Segmentation

This repository contains the code developed for a bachelor thesis project at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

The project explores how food segmentation and ingredient-level metadata can improve the accuracy and robustness of nutrient estimation from food images. The approach combines segmentation masks and BERT-encoded ingredient features as inputs to a lightweight machine learning model. Performance is evaluated using MAE and SMAPE, including tests under various image degradations (e.g., blur, noise, brightness, resolution loss).

This codebase supports the experiments, evaluations, and visualizations conducted as part of the thesis.

All images used in this project (~60,000 food photos), including original, segmented, and degraded versions, are available here:
